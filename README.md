# R for Data Science — Learning Journal

Working through R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham (r4ds.had.co.nz).
I am self-learning R during National Service with the goal of connecting
data science to financial markets and FinTech — where I'm already
spending most of my time.

## What's in here
- Chapter code-alongs and exercise attempts
- Notes on concepts and core principles that are tricky

## Tools used
- R / RStudio
- tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr)

## Background
I have nearly 6 years of hands-on cryptocurrency market research and
trading experience. This R journey is part of building the formal
toolkit to complement what I've been doing informally for years.
